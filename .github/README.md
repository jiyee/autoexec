## Installation

##### Downloading and installing steps:
1. **[Download](https://github.com/ArmynC/ArminC-AutoExec/archive/master.zip)** the latest version of the config.
2.  Open the _archive_ and **extract** the contents of the `cfg` folder into the following path folder:<br>
`\...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\`
3. **Launch** the game and **type** in the _console_ the following command: `exec autoexec.cfg`
   * If the autoexec isn't booting, perhaps try to use the launch option: `+exec autoexec.cfg`
   * For a new desktop or operating system (e.g. Linux) make sure to put (again) in place all the files instead of letting the Steam cloud transfer them automatically.
